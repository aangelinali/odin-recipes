    <h4>Fully Decorated Black Forest Cake</h4>
    <p>German chocolate and cream cake with rich cherry filling. Perfect for all types of celebrations. Expected to take around 3 hours to make and serves about 12 people.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/8 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cans pitted sour cherries</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>3 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1/3 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans; line bottoms with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; beat until combined. Pour cake batter into the prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool layers in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Run a paring knife around edges to loosen and invert carefully onto racks to cool completely, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>While cake layers bake, drain cherries for topping, reserving 1/2 cup juice. Combine reserved juice, cherries, sugar, and cornstarch in a 2-quart saucepan.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring constantly, over low heat until thickened. Stir in vanilla. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator to cool completely before assembling cake.</li>
        <li>Combine whipping cream and confectioners' sugar for frosting in the chilled medium bowl. Beat with an electric mixer at high speed until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Split each cake layer in half horizontally using a long serrated knife. Tear one layer into crumbs; set aside. Gently brush loose crumbs off top and sides of remaining layers using a pastry brush or your hands.</li>
        <li>To assemble, place one cake layer on a cake plate. Spread with 1 cup frosting; top with 3/4 cup cherry topping. Top with second cake layer; repeat layers of frosting and cherry topping. Top with third cake layer and frost sides of cake.</li>
        <li>Pat reserved cake crumbs onto sides of cake. Spoon reserved 1 1/2 cups frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a star decorator tip. Pipe around top and bottom edges of cake. Spoon remaining cherry topping on top of cake.</li>
        <li>Store covered in the refrigerator until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
